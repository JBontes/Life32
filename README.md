# Life32

Life32 is a player/editor for conway's game of life and related CA's.  
_If you don't know what Life (or a CA) is, check out http://conwaylife.com_  

This is version 2.18 written in Delphi.  

In order for the code to compile, you need to install the components in Life32_v2.dpk first.  
The code has been tested with D7 and D_XE7, and it should compile with all current versions.  

It does not compile in Lazarus but making it compatible should not be too much work.  

You can find the binary files needed to run Life32 in the `Binary` folder.  
Just copy these into any folder and run the program from there.
