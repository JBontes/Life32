# Life32

Life32 is a player/editor for conway's game of life and related CA's.  
_If you don't know what Life (or a CA) is, check out http://conwaylife.com_  

This is version 2.18 written in Delphi.  

In order for the code to compile, you need to install the components in Life32_v2.dpk first.  
The code has been tested with D7 and D_XE7, and it should compile with all current versions.  

It does not compile in Lazarus but making it compatible should not be too much work.  

Note that the lastest version of the executable Life32.exe is also include for those people that don't feel like compiling from source.
