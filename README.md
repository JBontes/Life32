# Life32

Life32 is a player/editor for conway's game of life and related CA's.  
_If you don't know what Life (or a CA) is, check out http://conwaylife.com_  
Life32 will run on any Windows version from XP to 10. 

#Installing the program
You can find the binary files needed to run Life32 in the [`Binary`](https://github.com/JBontes/Life32/tree/master/Binary) folder.  
Just copy these into any folder and run the program from there.  


#Compiling the code
This is version 2.19 written in Delphi.  

In order for the code to compile, you need to install the components in Life32_v2.dpk first.  
The code has been tested with D7 and D_XE7, and it should compile with all current versions.  

It does not compile in Lazarus but making it compatible should not be too much work.
